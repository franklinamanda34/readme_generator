ABOUT
This repo contains an index.js file that I built to generate a functioning application for a user to gernerate a README.md file within the terminal

WHAT I LEARNED
-Building an index.js file can be very complex
-I learned two different options for formatting questions in an array. i.e. you can allow the user to input their own answer OR you can force the user to choose from a list of options for the answer
-ChatGPT and various git hub repos prove extremely useful during the debugging process. The most time consuming part of this code was within initializing the app. This is something that will definitley take a lot of trial and error to make sure you arent missing a single detail.
-First time using screencastify for an assignment(link is below)
