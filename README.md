README.MD GENERATOR
--Franklinamanda34--

ABOUT
This is an application that allows users to generate a readme file from the terminal

What did I learn?
-creating an interavtive index.js file using node can be very complex
-There are at least two different formats for questions in an array. A user can input their very own answer OR you can create a list and force the use to choose a default answer
-CHATGPT and git hub repos can be extremely useful for comparison when debugging an index.js file
-First time using screencastify for a demo. Very user friendly
